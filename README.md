# bashplus
Manage DNS Made Easy/Incapsula/Dyn with standards bash commands like ls, rm and cat. Vew their configuration as if it were a file system.

To get the idea, check my Wiki for [DNS Made Easy](https://github.com/monstruooo/bashplus/wiki/BashPlus-for-DNS-Made-Easy). 
I have screenshots there that illustrate the concept

Incasula and dyn.com right now can be viewed only as PDF. But their Wikis are coming too
1. [Incapsula](https://github.com/monstruooo/bashplus/blob/master/BashPlus_Incapsula_Extension_Walkthrough.pdf)
1. [dyn.com](https://github.com/monstruooo/bashplus/blob/master/DynDNSWalkthrough.pdf)

More providers to be added
